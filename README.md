2L version of my 1L MLP

To try, just run the python script. The weight matrices and input vector will be assigned random numbers.

Layer widths are both 10.

The input vector and output vectors have 10 elements.

The target vector is fixed.

You will need PyTorch to run it. I'm using version 2.5.1 and Python version 3.12.2.
